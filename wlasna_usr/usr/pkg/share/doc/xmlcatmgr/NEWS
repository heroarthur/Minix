XML Catalog Manager                                                    NEWS
===========================================================================


Version 2.2
-----------

Third stable version of the 2.x branch, released on 2004/09/01.

* Converted to use the GNU Build System (GNU Automake and GNU Autoconf).

* Because of the previous change, the build has been hopefully fixed in
  several platforms, specially under Irix 6.5 using the MIPSpro C compiler.


Version 2.1
-----------

Second stable version of the 2.x branch, released on 2004/05/02.

* Fixed an attribute name when parsing the `uri' tag in XML catalogs; it
  expects `name', not `uriId'.

* Fixed a warning message when removing entries from an XML catalog.

* Fixed several warnings when building mem.c code in a system with glibc
  2.[23].x and -O2 enabled.

* Added the `-p' flag which changes the behavior of the `add' action so
  that new entries are prepended instead of appended.

* Improved consistency of the lookup action so that it behaves equally
  for SGML and XML catalogs (this includes making XML lookup show all
  matching entries).

* Documentation is now installed in an unversioned directory by default.


Version 2.0
-----------

First stable version of the 2.x branch, released on 2004/03/26.

* Fixed build under HP-UX and Tru64 Unix.

* Fixed a crash that occurred during parsing of some malformed XML
  catalogs.


Version 2.0beta1
----------------

First beta version of the 2.x branch, released on 2004/01/23.

* Recognize two default catalog files, one for XML and one for SGML,
  instead of only one as in previous versions.

* Added the `-h' option to xmlcatmgr, which shows a descriptive usage
  message.

* Added multiple comments to the code, explaining what each function does.

* Some bug fixes.


Version 2.0alpha2
-----------------

Second alpha version of the 2.x branch, released on 2004/01/17.

* Fixes to allow multiple entries with the same content in both SGML and
  XML catalog files.  Sorry but this may break command line compatibility
  with old versions in some scenarios; that is, the "remove" action now
  takes pairs of values.  Even though, if just one argument is given to
  "remove", it behaves as before to help the transition to newer versions.

* New catalogs are created now in memory before writting them to disk.
  This ensures that they will look exactly the same after creation and
  after some manipulation (addition and removal of entries).

* Added an option to configure, '-n doc', to disable installation of
  distribution documentation files in the system.

* Some bug fixes.


Version 2.0alpha1
-----------------

First alpha version of the 2.x branch, released on 2003/12/23.

* xmlcatmgr has been completely rewritten in C.  Even though, command line
  compatibility has been kept, so that existing scripts using this program
  do not break.

* Buildtool is not used any more.  A custom build infrastructure has been
  implemented, as something small and very portable was needed.

* Added the `lookup' action, used to search for entries in catalogs.

* Added real parsers to manipulate SGML and XML catalogs.  The program is
  not line oriented any more, thus beeing a lot more flexible.

* Multiple race conditions fixed, which were unavoidable from a shell
  script.

* Better handling of special characters and spaces in strings, difficult
  to handle from shell scripts.


Version 1.2
-----------

Third stable version of the 1.x branch, released on 2003/12/16.

* Added the BT_PROG_GREP variable to the build system; this is to allow the
  user override the grep program used by xmlcatmgr.  In some systems, like
  Solaris, the -F flag is not supported, so an alternative must be used.


Version 1.1
-----------

Second stable version of the 1.x branch, released on 2003/10/11.

* Fixed AWK code generation to work with the mawk interpreter.

* Fixed Makefile.boot to install documentation inside the directory pointed
  by the BT_DIR_DOC variable.


Version 1.0
-----------

First stable version of the 1.x branch, released on 2003/09/08.

* Adapted Buildtool scripts to the latest version, 0.14.  As a side effect,
  distribution documentation is now installed into the system.

* Minor manpage fixes.

* Code cleanup.


Version 0.2
-----------

Second alpha version of the 1.x branch, released on 2003/01/28.

* Added XML Catalogs management.  You must use the new `-s' flag to handle
  SGML Catalogs as XML format becomes the default.

* Dropped use of getopt in favour of getopts, as the former does not handle
  whitespace in variables properly.

* Handle comments in SGML catalogs properly.

* Several manpage improvements.


Version 0.1
-----------

First alpha version of the 1.x branch, released on 2003/01/10.

* First public version.
